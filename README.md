# node-comfoairq
Library to control a Zehnder Comfoair Q series of ventilation devices

A Zehnder Comfoconnect LAN C interface is required to make this work

Development of this node.js plugin is heavily inspired on the work performed by:
* Michael Arnauts (https://github.com/michaelarnauts/comfoconnect)
* Marco Hoyer (https://github.com/marco-hoyer/zcan) and its forks (djwlindenaar, decontamin4t0R)

An API is provided to connect and read sensor data from the ComfoAirQ-unit

A test-application is provided to demonstrate the capabilities
